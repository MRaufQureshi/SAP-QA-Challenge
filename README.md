***Side note***

1. The duration required to complete the coding assignment exceeded the timeframe specified in the provided PDF document, which was allotted for 2 to 3 hours.
2. It's evident that the complexity of the task extends beyond the given time constraints. However, despite this challenge, I diligently endeavored to accomplish as much as feasibly possible within the timeframe.
3. Furthermore, I would like to draw attention to the fact that the acceptance criteria and test cases are contained within the file named "list-test-cases.md." I encourage you to review these documents for comprehensive understanding and evaluation.
